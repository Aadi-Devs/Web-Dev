React --> basically it is 3 things which are, 
state, components and re-rendering.

State :- Data that we work on, 
Component :- a wireframe in which our state is shown, 
Re-rendering :- happens whenever the state changes.

--> In react we don't have to re-render things by our own, react does that for us, we just have to tell what needs to be done when the state changes.

--> The reason of creating react was to make something that only re-renders the things which are changed not the entire project.

--> useState hook - used to change the state, it returns two things but in an array.
it is written like this,
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);   this is known as array destructuring


- it can also be like this which is a bit confusing,
const value = useState(0);
const count = value[0];
const setCount = value[1];


Q - How are we able to update the count even if it is a const?
--> because the array is a const but it's elements are not const so we can change them.
